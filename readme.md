Use sample.py to see how to construct, train and predict using a textCNN object. 

Doc2Vec implementations are under src/doc2vec_ver call doc2vec_textcnn_keras.py to load data and train the model; continue_keras_doc2vec.py to continue training of a model and predict_keras_doc2vec.py to predict using a pre-trained model. Remember to modify 'sequence_length' as defined by the training set. You do NOT have to do this for the version w/out doc2vec implementation
